       "['September proved volatile for Bitcoin, though the digital asset regained momentum late in the month. From Sept. 24 to Oct. 6, it rose 14%.',\n",
       " 'Increasing interest from institutional investors is sending a positive signal to the market, reflecting the confidence of the world’s largest institutions in digital currency. Additionally, pro-crypto moves by the Trump administration and the digital currency’s growing ties to the broader financial ecosystem are another key tailwind for the asset.',\n",
       " 'Bitcoin’s volatility has been a constant theme this year, led by trade war uncertainties. However, the fundamental drivers of digital currencies are expected to remain robust and support the anticipated stability ahead.',\n",
       " 'Further Fed interest rate cuts could boost investor risk appetite, potentially leading to increased exposure to digital currencies. Additionally, lower interest rates would leave investors with more capital, often leading to increased interest in cryptocurrency.',\n",
       " 'According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are anticipating a 92.5% likelihood of an interest rate cut in October and a 99% likelihood of a rate cut in December. Additionally, the possibility of a weaker greenback adds to the digital currency’s appeal.',\n",
       " \"The greenback's value tends to move inversely with interest rate adjustments by the Fed. Interest rate cuts by the Fed make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors, as this weakens it. Cryptocurrency, an alternative to traditional currencies, could benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.\",\n",
       " 'Cryptocurrency sentiment is turning upbeat this October, with analysts eyeing a potential “Uptober” rally, as quoted on TradingView. The optimism stems from historical data, which indicates that October is traditionally the strongest month for the asset.',\n",
       " 'Per the abovementioned article, since 2011, Bitcoin has posted gains in the month 83% of the time and recorded losses only twice, setting the stage for another bullish October. Past trends indicate that a green September usually sets the stage for October rallies. Following an 8% increase last month, the digital asset appears set to extend its rally.',\n",
       " 'Below, we have mentioned a few ETFs for investors to increase their portfolios’ exposure to digital currencies, taking advantage of the favorable macroeconomic landscape and the long-term optimistic outlook for digital assets.',\n",
       " 'However, investing in digital currencies does require increased risk appetite and tolerance for extreme volatility. It’s important for investors to stay alert and track the developments. Despite short-term price swings, the long-term outlook for digital currencies remains optimistic.',\n",
       " 'Investors can consider funds like IShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust BITB.',\n",
       " 'With a one-month average trading volume of 48.02 million shares, IBIT is the most liquid option, ideal for active trading strategies. IBIT has also gathered an asset base of $96.2 billion, the largest among the other options.',\n",
       " 'ARKB is the cheapest option among the above-mentioned funds, charging 0.21%, and is more suitable for long-term investing. Investors can also look at Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust\\xa0BTC, which is a cheaper alternative to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. BTC charges an annual fee of 0.15%.',\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "## Agent Design and Workflows\n",
    "The agents used throughout this notebook have been tool-calling agents. They do not possess the full autonomy that comes from code agents, but they are more predictable and have better guardrails against becoming too creative in their problem-solving endeavors.  In our example, each agent has access to only one tool outside of the tool used to pass its answer back to the parent model and/or user.  This makes each agent extremely specialized. While a more generalized approach may offer more flexibility, this specialist approach simplified the routing by calling the agents in a very linear manner, much like you would see from a human prompt chaining a single model with multiple tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Functions and Capabilities\n",
    "Some of our agents are complex, while others are relatively simple.  For instance, our Sentiment agent calculates a VADER sentiment score and a BERT sentiment score from articles pulled from multiple news outlets.  Performance uses DeepAR, a deep ARIMA model, along with linear regression and a short-term moving average over several time periods.  On the simpler side, we have a purely random Impact agent.  However, we could make each model more robust as we discover better ways to calculate meaningful results in the agent's area of expertise.  This is one of the allure of this agentic approach.  We can gradually make each more of an expert in their particular slice of the equation, thus driving greater results over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation and Iteration\n",
    "As can be seen from the code, the evaluation mock-up is very similar to our actual agent code.  However, we needed to use a mock-up because our agent code is not dynamic enough to allow the commanding agent to adjust hyperparameters.  Looking at the mock-up, it should be apparent that if the impact weight were adjusted high enough to cause the recommendation to become 'BUY' rather than 'HOLD', the evaluator would then recommend increasing the risk weight because the stock would be considered too risky to purchase.  In this way, we can allow the model to tune itself to an arbitrary precision.  Of course, there would need to be some sort of stop criteria included to guard against excessive (and possibly infinite) tuning iterations."
